        "1. Switched from manual padding to packed sequences\n",
        "Using pack_padded_sequence improved efficiency and performance by avoiding computation on unnecessary padding tokens, which previously degraded learning quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Model architecture tuning\n",
        "Increasing epochs to 100, setting hidden_size=128, and using 2 LSTM layers provided better capacity and representation learning, leading to improved accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Learning rate tuning\n",
        "A higher learning rate of 0.001 accelerated learning and initially led to 82% accuracy, but also introduced instability (e.g., NaN losses), likely due to exploding gradients. Gradient clipping was later used to stabilize training.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Loss function change: MSE → CrossEntropyLoss\n",
        "Switching to CrossEntropyLoss helped significantly. Unlike MSE, which doesn’t penalize incorrect class predictions effectively, cross-entropy provides stronger gradients for misclassified examples and supports faster, more stable convergence for classification tasks.\n",
        "Further updated from CrossEntropyLoss to Focalloss as CrossEntropyLoss was favoring majority classes and ignoring the minority and hence was misclassifying all of the minority classes. With the appropriate weightage the focus was evenly distributed. In addition introducing dropout 0.3 helped avoiding overfitting and generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Introduced Bidirectional LSTM\n",
        "Using a bidirectional LSTM improved the model’s ability to capture context from both past and future tokens. This helped in understanding musical structure more holistically, leading to better generalization and higher accuracy.Manual padding has decreased the efficiency as compared to Packed sequence, because we avoid the unnecessary padding to the max sie.\n"
